# DLE-DG-Dataset
The dataset used in "DLE-DG: Decoupling Location and Environment Representations for Domain Generalization in RFID Fingerprint Indoor Localization" is structured as a tensor of size n × 280, where n denotes the total number of samples. The dataset is publicly available in the DLE-DG GitHub Releases repository; specifically, data.pt contains the input signal features (RSSI and phase), and dataLabels.pt contains the corresponding labels, each formatted as a two-element vector [location_id, environment_id].
